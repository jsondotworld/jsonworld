# jsonworld

Data about the world in machine-readable JSON format, based on the most reputable sources possible. Goals:

1. Provide datasets frequently needed in (web) applications, e.g. ISO country codes
1. Gather the data by scraping it from the most trusted sources possible, e.g. Wikipedia
1. Export strong types based on that data and enforce them in the process
1. Support different languages by distributing the data in all relevant package repositories
